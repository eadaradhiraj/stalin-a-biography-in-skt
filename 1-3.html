            <span class="sentence-2" onclick="highlight('sentence-2')">Not having spoken Russian at home, he stayed in the preparatory classes for two years.</span>
            <span class="sentence-3" onclick="highlight('sentence-3')">But he proved a quick learner and already knew enough of the language to leap over the beginners’ class.</span>
            <span class="sentence-4" onclick="highlight('sentence-4')">He started the full course in September 1890.</span>
            <span class="sentence-5" onclick="highlight('sentence-5')">Beso Dzhughashvili had never liked the idea of his boy becoming a scholar.</span>
            <span class="sentence-6" onclick="highlight('sentence-6')">At some early stage of Joseph’s course at the Gori Spiritual School, there was a terrible row between Beso and Keke.</span>
            <span class="sentence-7" onclick="highlight('sentence-7')">The angry Beso triumphed and took Joseph back to Tbilisi with him to work at the Adelkhanov Shoe Factory.</span>
            <span class="sentence-8" onclick="highlight('sentence-8')">Joseph was to become an apprentice and drop Keke’s plan for him to enter the priesthood.</span>
            <span class="sentence-9" onclick="highlight('sentence-9')">Beso was a drunk and a failed artisan; but his attitude was not unusual.</span>
            <span class="sentence-10" onclick="highlight('sentence-10')">He insisted that what was good enough for him in employment was equally appropriate for his offspring.</span>

            <span class="sentence-11" onclick="highlight('sentence-11')">The authorities categorised the Adelkhanov Shoe Factory as among the most decent in Georgia towards its eighty workers since, unlike rival factories, it had its own medical facilities.</span>
            <span class="sentence-12" onclick="highlight('sentence-12')">Yet most people thought Emile Adelkhanov, who had opened his enterprise in 1875, a harsh exploiter of his workforce.</span>
            <span class="sentence-13" onclick="highlight('sentence-13')">Wages were low and the conditions were especially harsh for young boys – indeed the same authorities worried about the large number of youngsters employed by Adelkhanov and about the effects on their health and upbringing in the grim, rectangular building.</span>
            <span class="sentence-14" onclick="highlight('sentence-14')">Adelkhanov was no philanthropist.</span>
            <span class="sentence-15" onclick="highlight('sentence-15')">When the terms of trade turned against him at the end of the century, he instantly cut wages.</span>
            <span class="sentence-16" onclick="highlight('sentence-16')">The result was a bitterly fought strike.</span>
            <span class="sentence-17" onclick="highlight('sentence-17')">For Beso Dzhughashvili, however, Adelkhanov’s cost-cutting recruitment of minors was a definite attraction.</span>
            <span class="sentence-18" onclick="highlight('sentence-18')">The extra money, however small initially, would come in useful: Joseph could start to pay his own way.</span>
            <span class="sentence-19" onclick="highlight('sentence-19')">He would not see much of the centre of Tbilisi with its palaces, cathedrals and grand shops.</span>
            <span class="sentence-20" onclick="highlight('sentence-20')">They lodged in a cheap room in the Avlabari district on the left bank of the River Mtkvari and each day walked down past the Metekhi Prison and over the bridge into the winding, cobbled streets of the Ortachala district where the factory stood.</span>
            <span class="sentence-21" onclick="highlight('sentence-21')">Joseph’s first encounter with capitalism was raw, harsh and dispiriting.</span>

            <span class="sentence-23" onclick="highlight('sentence-23')">A mixture of cultures existed around the Adelkhanov Shoe Factory.</span>
            <span class="sentence-24" onclick="highlight('sentence-24')">Apart from the rival Mantashëv Shoe Factory there were synagogues for the Tbilisi Jews, several Armenian churches and half a dozen Georgian churches.</span>
            <span class="sentence-25" onclick="highlight('sentence-25')">Near by there were the sulphur baths used by the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin earlier in the century.</span>
            <span class="sentence-26" onclick="highlight('sentence-26')">The entire area, including the gently bubbling stretch of the River Mtkvari, lay across hot springs valued for their medicinal properties.</span>
            <span class="sentence-27" onclick="highlight('sentence-27')">During his time in the factory, Joseph Dzhughashvili was being shown that a wider world of experience existed than he could possibly have imagined as a schoolboy in Gori.</span>

            <span class="sentence-28" onclick="highlight('sentence-28')">If Beso had continued to prevail, there would have been no Stalin – and world history would have been different.</span>
            <span class="sentence-29" onclick="highlight('sentence-29')">To rise to the peak of the Russian Communist Party in the 1920s it was to be essential to have a fluent and plausible pen; and much as he resented the priests who taught him, Joseph owed them a lasting debt for his education.</span>
            <span class="sentence-30" onclick="highlight('sentence-30')">He was also beholden to his mother’s refusal to accept defeat.</span>
            <span class="sentence-31" onclick="highlight('sentence-31')">Doting on her departed son, she went to the priests in Gori and got them to help her to constrain Beso to release Joseph from factory work.</span>
            <span class="sentence-32" onclick="highlight('sentence-32')">Beso relented, and after a few months Joseph returned to his desk at the Spiritual School.</span>
            <span class="sentence-33" onclick="highlight('sentence-33')">Unsurprisingly he had not become a proficient cobbler in that brief period.</span>
            <span class="sentence-34" onclick="highlight('sentence-34')">His tasks had been limited to fetching and carrying for the adults in the factory.</span>
            <span class="sentence-35" onclick="highlight('sentence-35')">But he had seen enough of contemporary manufacturing to avoid a repetition of the experience.</span>
            <span class="sentence-36" onclick="highlight('sentence-36')">It proved to be his only opportunity to know industrial work directly, but not once did he refer to it in print.</span>
            <span class="sentence-37" onclick="highlight('sentence-37')">Although he was to write in later years about ‘the working class’ and ‘the factory system’, he was mostly drawing on conversations he had with workers of the sort he never became.</span>

            <span class="sentence-39" onclick="highlight('sentence-39')">It is not known how many times, if any, he returned to Gori.</span>
            <span class="sentence-40" onclick="highlight('sentence-40')">What is sure is that he never lived there for any lengthy time again.</span>
            <span class="sentence-41" onclick="highlight('sentence-41')">His drinking seems to have taken him over as he moved from job to job.</span>
            <span class="sentence-42" onclick="highlight('sentence-42')">There is a legend that Joseph murdered Beso.</span>
            <span class="sentence-43" onclick="highlight('sentence-43')">Not a scrap of evidence has been found for this and the truth was probably much more prosaic.</span>
            <span class="sentence-44" onclick="highlight('sentence-44')">Beso, having made a mess of his life, coped on his own.</span>
            <span class="sentence-45" onclick="highlight('sentence-45')">He worked in factories, drank in taverns and eventually lost all control of his life.</span>
            <span class="sentence-46" onclick="highlight('sentence-46')">According to some accounts, he died before the turn of the century; but the likelihood is that Beso, alone and destitute, died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1909.</span>

            <span class="sentence-48" onclick="highlight('sentence-48')">Quite how Joseph dealt with the breakdown in his parents’ marriage and his father’s departure is unclear.</span>
            <span class="sentence-49" onclick="highlight('sentence-49')">But clues survive.</span>
            <span class="sentence-50" onclick="highlight('sentence-50')">When he published poems in 1895–6, ‘Besoshvili’ was among his pseudonyms.</span>
            <span class="sentence-51" onclick="highlight('sentence-51')">This was clearly not an accidental choice.</span>
            <span class="sentence-52" onclick="highlight('sentence-52')">Nor was the reference in one of his early articles to how the capitalist economy put independent craftsmen under huge commercial pressure and forced most of them to give up their workshops and enter factory employment.</span>
            <span class="sentence-53" onclick="highlight('sentence-53')">The conclusion is irresistible.</span>
            <span class="sentence-54" onclick="highlight('sentence-54')">Joseph did not share his father’s ambition for him.</span>
            <span class="sentence-55" onclick="highlight('sentence-55')">He did not like being beaten.</span>
            <span class="sentence-56" onclick="highlight('sentence-56')">He had erupted in fury at Beso’s ill-tempered demands and behaviour.</span>
            <span class="sentence-57" onclick="highlight('sentence-57')">But Joseph was a thoughtful as well as sensitive child.</span>
            <span class="sentence-58" onclick="highlight('sentence-58')">When he started to think as a Marxist, he came to see Beso as a victim of history.</span>
            <span class="sentence-59" onclick="highlight('sentence-59')">This would surely not have happened if, at the back of his mind, Joseph had not retained a feeling of affection and understanding for his father.</span>
            <span class="sentence-60" onclick="highlight('sentence-60')">This may appear paradoxical.</span>
            <span class="sentence-61" onclick="highlight('sentence-61')">Stalin, Beso’s victim, kept fond thoughts of the man who had maltreated him.</span>
            <span class="sentence-62" onclick="highlight('sentence-62')">This is not an unusual reaction.</span>
            <span class="sentence-63" onclick="highlight('sentence-63')">The fact that Beso had passed out of his life probably helped Joseph to sanitise his recollections.</span>

            <span class="sentence-65" onclick="highlight('sentence-65')">It was an eventful period.</span>
            <span class="sentence-66" onclick="highlight('sentence-66')">While standing outside church one day, Joseph was knocked down by a phaeton.</span>
            <span class="sentence-67" onclick="highlight('sentence-67')">This was a horse-drawn trap, typically with two or three seats for its occupants, primitive suspension-hoops and a simple set of shafts.</span>
            <span class="sentence-68" onclick="highlight('sentence-68')">Open to the air, it was one of the cheapest forms of carriage.</span>
            <span class="sentence-69" onclick="highlight('sentence-69')">The driver that day in Gori lost control of his horse.</span>
            <span class="sentence-70" onclick="highlight('sentence-70')">The phaeton careered towards the crowd by the church wall and young Joseph Dzhughashvili did not move out of the way in time.</span>

            <span class="sentence-76" onclick="highlight('sentence-76')">It was to be the reason why he was not called up into the Imperial Army in 1916–17.</span>
            <span class="sentence-77" onclick="highlight('sentence-77')">Thus an unruly horse, by trampling the Gori youngster, was instrumental in saving him from potential annihilation in the Great War.</span>
            <span class="sentence-78" onclick="highlight('sentence-78')">The accident made him ungainly and apparently embarrassed about his appearance.</span>
            <span class="sentence-79" onclick="highlight('sentence-79')">Another point of psychological stress was added to the list.</span>
            <span class="sentence-80" onclick="highlight('sentence-80')">Nor did the injury enhance his prowess in the trials of strength among the boys of the town.</span>

            <span class="sentence-82" onclick="highlight('sentence-82')">Schoolmate Joseph Iremashvili recalled how young Dzhughashvili continued to use dirty methods to win his wrestling bouts.</span>
